In this update, we have successfully published our customized version of the
ablog extension, now called *photon-ablog*, to PyPI. The following changes were
made during the process:

1. **Renamed the project**: We updated the package name in the ``setup.cfg``
   file to reflect our custom version. The new package name is
   ``photon-ablog``.

   .. code-block:: cfg

      [metadata]
      name = photon-ablog

2. **Removed old Git tags**: We removed the Git tags inherited from the
   original ablog repository, both locally and remotely. This was done to avoid
   confusion and to make sure that our new package versioning is based on our
   project's tags.

3. **Created a new Git tag**: We created a new Git tag with an updated version
   number for our custom extension. This ensures that our package has a unique
   version number when published to PyPI.

4. **Removed local version identifiers**: To comply with PEP 440 and avoid
   versioning issues, we customized the versioning schema in the ``setup.py``
   file to remove local version identifiers generated by ``setuptools_scm``.

5. **Cleaned up build artifacts**: We removed the old ``dist`` and
   ``*.egg-info`` directories to make sure that our new package build reflects
   the latest changes and has a valid version number.

With these changes in place, our custom extension, *photon-ablog*, is now
available on PyPI for users to install and use.

To install *photon-ablog*, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install photon-ablog
